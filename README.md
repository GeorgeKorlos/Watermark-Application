# Watermark Application

This project is part of **Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code** course. It is a graphical user interface (GUI) application built with **Python** and **Tkinter** that allows users to upload an image, add a custom text watermark, and save the watermarked image.

## Features:
- Upload images (supports `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, and `.png` formats).
- Add a text watermark to the image.
- Save the watermarked image as a `.png` file.

## How to Use:
1. **Upload Image:** Click the "Upload Image" button to select an image from your local machine.
2. **Add Watermark:** Type the desired watermark text in the entry field and click "Add Text Watermark."
3. **Save Image:** After adding the watermark, click the "Save Image" button to save the watermarked image to your computer.

## Requirements:
- **Python 3.x**
- **Tkinter** (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
- **Pillow** library for image processing. Install it using:

```bash
pip install Pillow
```

## Running the Application:

To run the application, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python watermark_app.py
```
This will launch the watermark app window where you can interact with the features described above.
